This is dtrade, a web application for trading stocks with play money. Made for CS50x class from Harvard.

Users create a username and password, and their account is stocked with $10000 of play money. They can use a Stock Lookup tool 
to find stocks by their symbol, which will reveal the name of the company and current stock price. From here, you can purchase
as many shares as you can afford. Later on, you can sell your shares via your portfolio page. The portfolio shows all current 
stocks and their values. The history page shows all transactions that have been completed.
